# ICE_Signal_Processing
This repository contains an example of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) denoising applied to a signal consisting of a mixture of sinusoids corrupted by white noise. The example is implemented in C++ using the Eigen library for matrix operations and the standard C++ random library for generating white noise.
